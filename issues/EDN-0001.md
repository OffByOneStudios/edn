I’ll summarize our Phase 5 Rust work to date, highlight the current blocker, what we tried, and the next concrete fixes I propose.

## checklist
- Progress recap on Phase 5 Rust integration and tooling
- Current problem description with IR evidence
- What we attempted (code-level changes)
- Proposed next steps (targeted, verifiable)

## progress recap
- Frontend and lowering
  - Rustlite → EDN pipeline with macro/trait expansion, type checking, and pretty EDN printing.
  - Core EDN → LLVM IR emitter implemented for arithmetic, control flow, slots for address-taken/assigned vars, and condition re-evaluation.
- JIT/Debug experience
  - Rustlite JIT driver supports --debug to print: Rust source, Frontend EDN, Lowered Core EDN, and LLVM IR.
  - IR verification added prior to JIT.
  - Watchdog timeout (10s) added to Rustlite JIT driver to avoid hangs.
- Mutability and slots
  - Introduced slot-backed locals for mutable variables: ensureSlot(name, type, initFromCurrent).
  - getVal prioritizes loads from slots when present.
  - Implemented “as” handling: allocate slot, store initializer, expose current SSA for the var.

Key files touched:
- edn.cpp (IR emitter): getVal, ensureSlot, assign, “as” handling, condition recomputation, control flow blocks.
- rustlite_jit_driver.cpp: --debug output, IR verify, and 10s timeout.

## current problem
- Non-terminating inner loop due to incrementing z from a constant initializer instead of z’s current value.
- IR evidence (from your dump):
  - `%__rl_c26.cst.tmp` → store 0 → `%__rl_c26.cst.load = load i32, ptr %__rl_c26.cst.tmp`
  - Then inside the loop:
    - `%__rl_op28 = add i32 %__rl_c26.cst.load, 2`
    - `store i32 %__rl_op28, ptr %z.slot`
- This always writes 2 to `%z.slot`. Since `z` never grows, `z > x` never becomes true, and the `while (true)` never breaks.

## what we attempted
- Slot semantics for mutable vars:
  - “as” now allocates `%dst.slot`, stores the initializer, and exposes an SSA load `%dst`.
  - getVal loads from slots when a name has a tracked slot.
- Aliasing to redirect reads of the initializer symbol to the variable’s slot:
  - Added an `initAlias` map: when emitting `(as %dst <ty> %initSym)`, record `initAlias[initSym] = dst`.
  - In getVal, consult `initAlias` before falling back, and load from the aliased var’s slot.
- Verification
  - Rebuilt and ran with --debug to inspect IR. The IR still shows `%__rl_op28 = add i32 %__rl_c26.cst.load, 2`, meaning the alias redirect didn’t trigger for the late-emitted `%__rl_c26.cst.load` symbol.

Why it didn’t fix it:
- The operand used by the loop increment is a suffixed SSA name (`__rl_c26.cst.load`) rather than the plain initializer name we aliased (e.g., `__rl_c26`). Our alias map check didn’t normalize/strip suffixes, so it didn’t match and didn’t redirect to `%z.slot`.

## what I want to try next
- Strengthen getVal with name normalization and alias redirect
  - Normalize candidate names by stripping known suffixes: “.cst.load”, “.load”, “.cst.tmp”, “.tmp”.
  - Check `initAlias` using both the exact name and the normalized base. If aliased, load from the variable’s slot.
  - This will turn the inner increment into “load %z.slot + 2,” allowing z to grow and the break to trigger.
- Ensure initial store to z.slot happens before its first use
  - Confirm the `(as %z ...)` path stores an initial value into `%z.slot` before entry to the inner loop (it should; if missing in this case, add an explicit store).
- Audit direct vmap reads in ops that might bypass getVal
  - Replace or gate them through getVal (or add equivalent alias checks) so slot-backed loads are always used for mutable names and their initializer aliases.
- Guardrail tests
  - Add a small IR-oriented test (or sample) that verifies increments on a var declared with “as” compile to a load from the slot + store back, not from a constant.
- Rebuild and validate
  - Rebuild and run the same sample with --debug, and check the inner loop IR shows “load i32, ptr %z.slot” in the add operand. Confirm the program exits normally or prints the JIT result.

## how to run (reference)
- Program: rustlite_jit_driver.exe
- Args: `E:/src/github.com/offbyonestudios/edn/languages/rustlite/samples/complex_lowering.rl.rs --debug`

## quality gates
- Build: Passing (Release/Debug) after the last changes.
- Verify: IR verification passes; debug IR printed.
- Runtime: JIT run times out currently due to the inner loop bug (watchdog works as intended).

Completion summary
- We built end-to-end Rustlite → EDN → LLVM IR → JIT with debug visibility and safety.
- We fixed mutability semantics for most cases and added an alias map, but the inner loop still uses a suffixed initializer symbol. Normalizing names in getVal and redirecting to the slot will unblock this. I’ll implement that next and re-run the sample to confirm the loop terminates and the JIT result prints.

## 2025-08-18 update — attempt to fix z increment still loading from initializer

What I did today
- Reproduced the hang with the JIT driver on `languages/rustlite/samples/complex_lowering.rl.rs` using `--debug` to dump Frontend EDN, Lowered Core EDN, and LLVM IR.
- Implemented two targeted IR-emitter changes in `src/edn.cpp`:
  1) Integer arithmetic (add/sub/mul/…): switched operands to resolve via the general `getVal` path so slot-backed locals and alias redirects are honored.
  2) Strengthened operand resolution with an explicit resolver that:
     - Normalizes synthesized suffixes (`.cst.load`, `.load`, `.cst.tmp`, `.tmp`).
     - Checks `initAlias` for both exact and normalized names, loading from the owning var’s slot when aliased.
     - Prefers loading from a variable’s slot when one exists; otherwise falls back to `getVal`.
- Rebuilt `edn.lib` and `rustlite_jit_driver.exe` (Release) and reran the sample with `--debug`.

Observed result (still failing)
- The emitted IR still shows the increment using the initializer constant instead of `%z.slot`:
  - In `while.end.14` leading into the inner loop, we see:
    - `%__rl_c26.cst.tmp` → store 0 → `%__rl_c26.cst.load = load i32, ptr %__rl_c26.cst.tmp`
  - In `while.body.22`:
    - `%__rl_op28 = add i32 %__rl_c26.cst.load, 2`
    - `store i32 %__rl_op28, ptr %z.slot`
- Runtime still times out via the 10s watchdog; loop doesn’t break.

Notes and hypotheses
- The Lowered Core EDN clearly emits `add %__rl_op28 i32 %z %__rl_c27`, so `%z` should resolve through the slot path. However, the IR uses `%__rl_c26.cst.load` as the first operand.
- Possible reasons:
  - A secondary/older arithmetic emission path is still in use for this case (bypassing the updated resolver).
  - `getVal` isn’t reached for `%z` in this context due to an early direct `vmap` lookup or inlined constant.
  - The `%z` SSA in `vmap` is being overwritten to alias the initializer in a way that our slot/alias checks don’t catch late in emission for this loop.

Next steps (focused)
1) Audit for any remaining direct `vmap[...]` reads in integer arithmetic or places that compute `%__rl_op28` and route them through the slot/alias-aware resolver. In particular, search for legacy helpers that may still emit arithmetic for ints separately.
2) Instrument `getVal` and the arithmetic emission to confirm the branch taken for `%z` (e.g., temporarily give unique debug names to loads from `%z.slot` to ensure they appear in IR, or add a one-time remark via named metadata). Remove after verification.
3) Add a minimal regression in `tests/` mirroring:
   - `(as %z i32 0) (const %two i32 2) (add %r i32 %z %two) (assign %z %r)`
   - Expect the IR to contain a `load i32, ptr %z.slot` as the first operand of the `add`.
4) Re-run JIT on `complex_lowering.rl.rs` and confirm the inner loop IR shows a load from `%z.slot` and that the program exits and prints a result.

Build/Run status today
- Build: OK (Release). IR verification passes.
- Run: Still hangs; IR unchanged in the critical `while.body.22` segment.
