# EDN-0007: Phase 4 Port Completion & Parity Follow-ups

Status: OPEN  
Priority: High (stabilize & polish after initial macOS Phase 4 green)  
Owner: Unassigned  
Created: 2025-08-22

## Summary
Phase 4 tests now pass on macOS (see closure of EDN-0002, 0003, 0005, 0006). This issue consolidates the remaining parity, polish, and cross‑platform tasks that were intentionally deferred to keep the port moving. Completing this list will fully retire residual monolithic logic, hardcoded fallbacks, and missing debug / test coverage.

## Remaining Work Breakdown

### A. Debug Info (migrated from EDN-0004)
- [x] Extract remaining inline DI logic from `src/edn.cpp` into `ir/di.cpp` (residual lexical block pushes, any direct DIBuilder uses).
- [x] Central `declare_local` helper (choose dbg.declare vs dbg.value) and replace ad‑hoc sites (variable, alloca, struct literal unified).
- [x] Match bind DI (`dbg.value` for each bound field) implemented in `control_ops.cpp`.
- [x] Closure thunk + closure struct DI (DISubprogram + env param variable + captured struct local) added in `closure_ops.cpp`.
- [x] Add scope nesting / shadowing test (`phase4_debug_info_scopes_test.cpp`) with real distinct allocas + DILocalVariable for shadowed names.
- [x] Add struct member offset assertion test (`phase4_debug_info_struct_member_offsets_test.cpp`) validating DI member offsets vs DataLayout.
- [x] Pseudo line mapping (simple monotonic counter) for lexical blocks & locals.
Progress: Shadowing, locals, match binds, closure DI, pseudo line mapping, generic `(block ...)` lexical scope emission, scopes test, and struct member offset DI validation are now integrated. Debug info extraction from `edn.cpp` completed (helpers: `setup_function_entry_debug`, `finalize_module_debug`).

### B. Resolver & Orchestration Cleanup (from EDN-0005 / EDN-0003)
- [x] Unify value resolution helpers (`ensureSlot`, `getVal`, `evalDefined`) into a single resolver utility (wrapper shims remain in `builder.hpp` for transition).
- [x] Remove transitional builder wrappers; all call sites now directly use `edn::ir::resolver::{get_value, eval_defined}` (2025-08-24).
- [x] Extract function definition creation into `function_builder` module (2025-08-24).

### C. Windows & Cross-Platform Validation
- [ ] Run full Phase 4 suite on Windows (Itanium vs SEH personality selection sanity) and fix any SEH regressions.
- [ ] Verify `_putenv` shim is excluded / guarded correctly on Windows builds.

### D. JIT & Coroutine / Panic Paths
- [x] Enable JIT smoke tests with `EDN_RUN_JIT=1` (add CI gating or local instruction) and ensure they pass. (Validated locally 2025-08-24: closures & coroutine JIT smokes green.)
- [x] Add coroutine minimal + suspend/final-suspend IR regression tests.
  - [x] Added initial minimal coroutine regression test (`phase4_coro_minimal_regression_test.cpp`) (2025-08-24).
  - [x] Enhanced minimal coroutine regression test to assert intrinsic presence & `presplitcoroutine` attribute when `EDN_ENABLE_CORO=1` (2025-08-24).
  - [x] Added suspend/final-suspend regression test (`phase4_coro_suspend_regression_test.cpp`) asserting presence of `coro.id`, `coro.begin`, `coro.save`, normal and final `coro.suspend` (i1 true) and `coro.end` plus attribute (2025-08-25).
- [x] Add panic unwind path regression tests (Itanium & SEH) verifying landingpad / cleanuppad sequence. (2025-08-25)

### E. ABI / VTable Emission Polish
- [x] Replace unconditional `%struct.ShowVT` fallback global with conditional emission (env var `EDN_FORCE_SHOWVT_FALLBACK=1`).
- [x] Add test ensuring fallback is not emitted when trait vtables are naturally generated (verify absence by default, presence only when env flag set). (2025-08-25)

### F. Pass / Verification Pipeline
- [x] Add regression test toggling `EDN_ENABLE_PASSES=1` with a minimal pipeline to confirm no DI or EH regressions. (2025-08-25)
- [x] Explicit test for `EDN_VERIFY_IR=1` path on representative modules (sums, EH, coroutines). (2025-08-25)

### G. Sum / Match Enhancements
- [x] Standardize naming of payload related temporaries (now `.payload.fN.{raw,ptr}`) and update docs if needed. (2025-08-25)
- [x] Add match binding offset IR test (validates raw GEP offsets for variant field binds). (2025-08-25)
- [x] Extend match binding offset test to also compare DWARF / DI offsets (DIDerivedType::getOffsetInBits) against computed payload field byte offsets. (2025-08-24)

### H. Documentation
- [x] Author `docs/DEBUG_INFO.md` (was acceptance item of EDN-0004) summarizing DI strategy & mapping. (2025-08-24)
- [x] Update `README.md` Phase 4 status section to reflect completed refactor & remaining follow-ups moved here. (2025-08-25)

### I. Quality Gates & Tooling
- [x] Add a lightweight DWARF / IR pattern utility (optional) or scripted grep harness for debug metadata validation. (scripts/di_grep_check.sh) (2025-08-24)
- [x] Ensure zero new Clang warnings after DI extraction (treat as failure in CI script if possible). (2025-08-25) (CI integration still optional; local build now warning-free with strict flags.)

## Acceptance Criteria
All unchecked (and partial `~`) tasks above completed; macOS & Windows Phase 4 suites (with optional JIT) green; DI tests cover scopes (including real shadowing), struct member offsets, match binds, closure thunks; fallback ShowVT logic removed or gated; resolver unification merged; documentation updated.
