# Epic: ABI & Runtime Formalization

## Goal
Define and implement a stable ABI and runtime contract for all values, functions, and ownership models crossing language boundaries.

## Why It Matters
- Ensures safe, predictable interop between languages and modules.
- Enables future optimizations (zero-copy, inlining, etc.) and deployment targets (Wasm, AOT).
- Reduces bugs and surprises for contributors and users.

## Success Criteria
- ABI spec covers all value types, calling conventions, and ownership rules.
- Automated tests verify ABI conformance across surfaces.
- Runtime helpers (alloc, drop, trait dispatch, etc.) are documented and stable.

## Key Steps
1. Write and maintain an ABI specification document.
2. Implement runtime helpers and ownership tracking.
3. Build ABI conformance tests (cross-language, cross-module).
4. Document runtime extension points for future targets.
